# Digital Tools for Citizen Science

Below is a curated list of awesome software and other resources to enable those who want to use scientific tools to empower communities and/or practice various forms of non-institutional science.  It is largely inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/drewrwilson/toolsforactivism) listing digital tools for activists.  Feel free to share suggestions. If you add software to the list, free and open-source software is strongly encouraged over proprietary software.

## questions and knowledge gaps:

* Ethics in research are often overseen by federal agencies or institutional review boards (IRBs). Is there a bottom-up, citizen-driven alternative to this?
* How can we organize this information better?
 
## How do I contribute to this list?

Have an idea of a tool that should be on this list? Here's how you can add it:
 * **Familiar with github?** Send a pull request with your suggestions. If you're not sure how to do that don't sweat it. See below.
 * **Not familiar with github?** You can leave a comment on this page by clicking on the `Issues` tab on the right and adding a New Issue (that's just like a comment). FYI you'll need to create a github account.
